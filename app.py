For instance, while RabbitMQ is the best supported message broker, it should never be used as a result store since it will drop results after being asked for them once. Both Redis and Memcache are good candidates for result stores.
     If you choose the same result store as message broker, you do not need to attach 2 add-ons. If not, make sure the result store add-on is attached.
